## **Overview**

This milestone focuses on **comprehensive testing and performance optimization** for the 5 IoT–Cardano integration templates.  
The goal was to ensure that each prototype operates stably and efficiently under real-world conditions, while also identifying and resolving key issues discovered during development.

Deliverables completed and verified in this milestone include:

1. **Testing Logs** — Screenshots and videos demonstrating testing processes for all prototypes.
2. **Issue Resolution Document** — Documentation of all identified bugs, their root causes, and implemented solutions.
3. **Performance Metrics Report** — Quantitative comparison of system performance before and after optimization.

All deliverables were applied and validated across the 5 IoT project templates.
