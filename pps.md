# Proposal setup

## Please provide your proposal title
Please note we suggest you use no more than 60 characters for your proposal title so that it can be easily viewed in the voting app.
The title should clearly express what the proposal is about. Voters can see the title in the voting app, even without opening the proposal, so a clear, unambiguous, and concise title is very important.

# Proposal Summary

## [Budget Information] Enter the amount of funding you are requesting in ADA
Each funding category has a minimum and maximum amount of funding a single proposal can request.
Cardano Use Cases: Prototype & Launch
. Minimum Funding Amount per proposal: $ADA 15,000
. Maximum Funding Amount per proposal: $ADA 200,000
1ADA=0.5USD

## [Time] Please specify how many months you expect your project to last
You are expected to produce the deliverables specified in the proposal within the timeframe selected, with a minimum of 2 months and a maximum of 12 months.
Projects can be completed earlier if milestone Proof-of-Achievements(https://docs.projectcatalyst.io/current-fund/project-onboarding/milestone-based-proposals) and Project Completion(https://docs.projectcatalyst.io/current-fund/general-information/project-close-out-report-and-project-close-out-video-pcr-and-pcv) steps are submitted and approved ahead of the expected delivery due dates in compliance with the Fund Rules(https://docs.projectcatalyst.io/current-fund/fund-basics/fund-rules).

## [Problem Statement] What is the problem you want to solve? (200-character limit including spaces)
Ensure you present a well-defined problem. What is the core issue that you hope to fix? Remember: the reader might not recognize the problem unless you state it clearly.
This answer will be displayed on the Catalyst voting app, so voters will see it even if they do not open your proposal to read it in detail.

## [Solution Overview] Summarize your solution to the problem (200-character limit including spaces)
Focus on what you are going to do, or change to solve the problem. Avoid "There should be a way to..." and ensure "We will build a...!".
Clearly state how the solution addresses the problem you have identified. Make sure you connect the 'why' and the 'how' of your solution.
This answer will be displayed on the Catalyst voting app, so voters will see it even if they do not open your proposal and read it in detail.

## [Supporting Documentation] Supporting Documentation
Here, provide links to your or your organization's website, repository, or marketing materials. Alternatively, provide links to any whitepaper or publication relevant to your proposal.
Note that this is additional information that voters and Community Reviewers might choose not to read. Attaching files does not mean you do not need to answer the questions in this form.

## [Project Dependencies] Does your project have any dependencies on other organizations, technical or otherwise
Does your project have any dependencies on other organizations, technical or otherwise?
List dependencies and prerequisites for your project's success. These are usually external factors (such as third-party suppliers, external resources, third-party software, etc.) that may cause a delay or represent a risk due to less control over resources.
In the case of third-party software, indicate whether you have the necessary licenses and permission to use such software.

Describe any dependencies or write 'No dependencies'
If "YES", please describe the dependencies and why you believe them essential to the project's delivery. If "NO", please write "No dependencies".

# MILESTONES

## What are the key milestones you need to achieve in order to complete your project successfully?
Please note milestones are only indicative during the proposal submission stage. Each funded project will formalize a milestone schedule and amounts during the onboarding stage.

## What are the key milestones you need to achieve in order to complete your project successfully?
For Grant Amounts of up to 75k ada, at least 2 milestones, plus the final one including Project Close-out Report and Video, must be included (3 milestones in total)
For Grant Amounts over 75k ada up to 150k ada, at least 3 milestones, plus the final one including Project Close-out Report and Video, must be included (4 milestones in total)
For Grant Amounts over 150k ada up to 300k ada, at least 4 milestones, plus the final one including Project Close-out Report and Video, must be included (5 milestones in total)
For Grant Amounts exceeding 300k ada, at least 5 milestones, plus the final one including Project Close-out Report and Video, must be included (6 milestones in total)

## Each milestone
Please follow this guideline (https://docs.projectcatalyst.io/current-fund/project-onboarding/milestone-based-proposals) to understand how to build your indicative milestones. Each milestone must have declared:
A. Milestone title (Enter the title for this milestone)
B. Milestone outputs (Describe the deliverables or outcomes for this milestone)
C. Acceptance criteria (Define the criteria for success in this milestone)
D. Evidence of completion (Specify the evidence that will demonstrate this milestone is complete)
E. Delivery Month (Enter the month when this milestone is expected to be delivered)
G. Cost in ADA (Important: Read the milestone guideline (https://docs.projectcatalyst.io/current-fund/project-onboarding/milestone-based-proposals) before proceeding)

# Final Pitch

## [RESOURCES] Who is in the project team and what are their roles?
List your team, their Linkedin profiles (or similar) and state what aspect of the proposal’s work each team member will undertake.
If you are planning to recruit additional team members, please state what specific skills you will be looking for in the people you recruit, so readers can see that you understand what skills will be needed to complete the project.
You are expected to have already engaged the relevant members of the organizations referenced so you understand if they are willing and/or have capacity to support the project. If you have not taken any steps to engage with your team yet, it is likely that the resources will not be available if you are approved for funding, which can jeopardize the project before it has even begun. The Catalyst team cannot help with this, meaning you are expected to have understood the requirements and engaged the necessary people before submitting a proposal.
Have you engaged anyone on any of the technical group channels (eg Discord or Telegram), or do you have a direct line of communications with the people and resources required?
Important: Catalyst funding is not anonymous, and some level of ‘proof of life’ verifications will take place before initial funding is released. Also remember that your proposal will be publicly available, so make sure to obtain any consent required before including confidential or third party information.
All Project Participants must disclose their role and scope of services across any submitted proposals, even if they are not in the lead or co-proposer role, such as an implementer, vendor, service provider, etc. Failure to disclose this information may lead to disqualification from the current grant round.

## [BUDGET & COSTS] Please provide a cost breakdown of the proposed work and resources
Make sure every element mentioned in your plan reflects its cost. It may be helpful to refer to your plan and timeline, list all the resources you will need at each stage, and what they cost.
Here, provide a clear description of any third party product or service you will be using. This could be hardware, software licenses, professional services (legal, accounting, code auditing, etc) but does not need to include the use of contracted programmers and developers.
The exact budget elements you include will depend on what type of work you are doing, and you might need to give less detail for a small, low-budget proposal. If the cost of the project will exceed the funding request, please provide information about alternative sources of funding.
Consider including budget elements for publicity / marketing / promotion / community engagement; project management; documentation; and reporting back to the community. Most proposals need these, but many proposers forget to include them.
It is the project team’s responsibility to properly manage the funds provided. Make sure to reference Fund Rules (https://docs.projectcatalyst.io/current-fund/fund-basics/fund-rules)  to understand eligibility around costs.

## [VALUE FOR MONEY] How does the cost of the project represent value for money for the Cardano ecosystem?
Use the response to provide the context about the costs you listed previously, particularly if they are high.
It may be helpful to include some brief information on how you have decided on the costs of the project. 
For instance, can you justify with supporting evidence that costs are proportional to the average wage in your country, or typical freelance rates in your industry? Is there anything else that helps to support how the project represents value for money?
