use aiken/crypto.{VerificationKeyHash}
use cardano/transaction.{InlineDatum, OutputReference, Transaction, find_input}
use cardano/tx

pub type Datum {
  owner: VerificationKeyHash,
  value: Int,
}

pub type Redeemer {
  Update
  Withdraw
}

validator confirm_status {
  spend(
    datum_otp: Option<Datum>,
    redeemer: Redeemer,
    output_reference: OutputReference,
    transaction: Transaction,
  ) {
    expect Some(datum_input) = datum_otp
    let Transaction { inputs, extra_signatories, .. } = transaction
    expect Some(input) = find_input(inputs, output_reference)
    expect InlineDatum(datum_output_inline) = input.output.datum
    expect datum_output: Datum = datum_output_inline
    when tx.verify_signature(extra_signatories, datum_input.owner) is {
      True ->
        when redeemer is {
          Update -> True
          Withdraw -> datum_output.value >= datum_input.value
        }

In this step, the formatted data is transmitted to the Cardano blockchain using CIP-68 for metadata management. The transmission process involves using smart contracts to record the data onto the blockchain.

- CIP-68 allows for seamless updates of the product’s metadata without needing to rewrite or replace the original transaction data, making it ideal for tracking supply chain events. For example, a product’s status or inspection results can be updated as it moves through various stages of the supply chain, and these updates can be tracked and validated efficiently. This ensures that all changes are captured as new metadata, preserving the integrity and traceability of the supply chain data.

- The IoT system will interface with the blockchain using APIs or SDKs specific to the Cardano platform. These APIs facilitate the creation of transactions that store the formatted data in the blockchain ledger. Secure transmission protocols like TLS/SSL will be used to ensure that data is securely sent over the network, preventing interception or tampering during transit. This function ensures that once data is entered into the blockchain, it becomes a permanent, auditable record.

3. Blockchain-based Data Validation

- After the data is transmitted to the blockchain, the next function is blockchain-based data validation. This step leverages the inherent capabilities of the Cardano blockchain to ensure that the data is legitimate and complies with predefined conditions. Smart contracts play a critical role in validating the data, verifying conditions such as product authenticity, location verification, and whether certain supply chain milestones have been met (e.g., shipment confirmation, quality checks).

- CIP-68 helps in validating metadata updates by ensuring that the product’s lifecycle information is captured, stored, and validated correctly. For example, each time a shipment reaches a new milestone, such as passing a quality control check or arriving at a warehouse, the metadata can be updated, and the Cardano blockchain will validate and record this new piece of information. Since CIP-68 ensures efficient metadata management, these updates are processed without issues and are part of a seamless supply chain experience.

- This validation helps to build trust in the supply chain by providing transparent and verifiable information about each product's journey from manufacturer to end customer.

4. Data Storage and Retrieval

- The final function involves data storage and retrieval, where the validated data is securely stored on the Cardano blockchain using CIP-68 to manage product metadata. Each transaction recorded on the blockchain contains information such as product details, timestamps, and location data, making it easily accessible for future retrieval. Blockchain's decentralized nature ensures that the data is distributed across multiple nodes, providing redundancy and security.

- With CIP-68, the system also allows for continuous updates to the metadata, ensuring that any changes to product information (such as packaging updates or inspection results) are efficiently handled and stored. This makes the Cardano blockchain an ideal platform for real-time product tracking and dynamic data updates.

- When authorized users, such as supply chain managers, customers, or regulatory bodies, need to retrieve the data, they can access it via blockchain explorers or specialized interfaces designed for the IoT supply chain system. The retrieval process is fast and secure, allowing real-time access to data on product status, inventory levels, or shipment history. This ensures that stakeholders can always access the most up-to-date, tamper-proof information to monitor the supply chain efficiently and effectively.
