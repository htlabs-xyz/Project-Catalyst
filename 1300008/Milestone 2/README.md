**Overview**

This milestone focuses on the **architecture design and prototype development** for 5 IoT–Cardano integration templates. Each project explores how IoT data can be validated and stored securely on the Cardano blockchain. All milestone deliverables have been successfully completed and verified, including:

1. Detailed system architecture documents for all 5 projects.
2. Working prototypes demonstrating data transmission, validation, and on-chain storage.
3. Comprehensive deployment and development guides with open-source code.

This report provides comprehensive documentation of all completed activities and progress made in this milestone.

## **1. System Architecture and Data Flow Documents.**

The following documents describe the architectural design, data flow, and integration process between IoT devices and the Cardano blockchain for each of the five project templates.

| **Project Template**            | **Architecture Document** | **Project Link**  |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------- | ----------------- |
| Smart Agriculture Monitoring    | [View Document](#)        | [Open Project](#) |
| Energy Consumption Tracking     | [View Document](#)        | [Open Project](#) |
| Environmental Data Logging      | [View Document](#)        | [Open Project](#) |
| Asset Tracking and Verification | [View Document](#)        | [Open Project](#) |
| Smart Supply Chain Validation   | [View Document](#)        | [Open Project](#) |

Each document includes component diagrams, module breakdowns, and detailed workflow illustrations to guide developers and learners through the integration process.
